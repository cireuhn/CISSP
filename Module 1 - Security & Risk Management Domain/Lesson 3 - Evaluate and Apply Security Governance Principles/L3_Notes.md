# Strategic Alignment

<u>Cybersecurity Function</u>
- Cybersecurity is the process by which an organization protects information, people, and infrastructure.

  - Time to debunk the myth that cybersecurity is an IT issue. It is an enterprise risk management issue!
	- IT professionals are important to ensure we have a safe and secure environment by managing controls, monitoring controls, recommending controls, and advise organizations, but all the decision-making related to cybersecurity should not be offloaded to the IT department
	- There should be contributors throughout the organization
  - Companies must address cyber-risk in a business context

<u>Security-in-Action</u>

You have been invited to observe an information technology department strategic planning meeting. The focus of the meeting is to evaluate new cybersecurity related products and services in the market. The meeting was intense and highly technical.

You leave the meeting concerned that the very enthusiastic IT team is "disconnected" from the rest of the organization

How would you express your observations?

<u>Observations & Recommendations</u>

Observations
- The core concept of strategic alignment seems to be missing
- The department is disproportionately taking responsibility for evaluating cyberscurity products and services

Recommendations
- Preface all further discussions with the mantra, "Every information security decision must be informed by *organizational goals and be in alignment with strategic objectives*."
- Include "business, system, and data owners" in the conversation. Be sure to use *business language*; not technical jargon.
